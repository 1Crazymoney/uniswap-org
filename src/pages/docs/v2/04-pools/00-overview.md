Token swaps are a simple way to exchange one ERC-20 token for another.

For end-users, swapping is intuitive: pick an input token, an output token, an input amount, and execute a market-price swap with one click. You can find documentation about trading using the web app at <Link to="/docs/v2/web-app/trading/">here.</Link>

Beneath the surface, token swaps are fulfilled by a system of smart contracts used by marketplace of participants.

Swaps can also be executed between programs, enabled by developers writing code that interacts directly with the Uniswap smart contracts. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap does not use an order book to represent liquidity or determine prices. Uniswap uses an automated market maker mechanism to provide instant feedback on exchange rates and slippage.
