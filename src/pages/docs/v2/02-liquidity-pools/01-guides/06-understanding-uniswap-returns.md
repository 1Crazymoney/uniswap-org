Uniswap incentives users to add liquidity to pools by rewarding providers with fees that are collected by the protocol. A 0.3% fee is taken for swapping between Ether and a token and roughly a 0.6% is token for token to tokens swaps.

In order to incentivize liquidity, Uniswap charges a 0.3% fee on each transaction. These fees are automatically added back to the market at the time of transfer, resulting in deeper spreads across the board. As such, liquidity provider’s pro-rata stake(s) grants them ownership over a larger pool of capital. Stated another way, the more transactions on a market, the more fees collected, and the more income a market maker earns when redeeming their liquidity token(s).

Arbitrage is the easiest use case to evaluate. **One of the interesting features of Uniswap is that with no order book, the only way the price can move is through trading. As the price in the wider market changes this inevitably leads to arbitrage opportunities. Accordingly, a certain volume of arbitrage trading on Uniswap, and hence fee income is, in practice, guaranteed. The expected volume of arbitrage trading based on historical price movements can be simulated.** A quick look at Binance data from November-January seems to suggest that fees from arbitrage may result in liquidity pool growth rates in the range 6–7%, even if no “real” trading is conducted on Uniswap. Whether this is true in the longer term depends on volatility in the ETH-DAI trading pair.

While, in the general sense, Uniswap market making is an interesting investment opportunity for retail investors, this doesn’t come without a catch. Market making, in general, is a complex activity which has the risk of losing money (compared to just **hodling**) in the case of big directional moves of the underlying asset price.
