Uniswap V2 enables building highly decentralized and manipulation-resistant on-chain price feeds.

Price oracles are a crucial to the viability and security of DeFi protocols. Until now, oracle designs between different projects have been implemented on an ad hoc basis, with varying degrees of decentralization and security. Because of this, the ecosystem has witnessed numerous high-profile hacks where the oracle implementation is often the main attack vector.

A lack of a robust oracle standard has held back both the adoption of DeFi and made it difficult and costly for new entrants to launch new products.

Enter Uniswap. As liquidity and trade volume on the protocol continue to grow, Uniswap's on-chain trade history is becoming an evermore valuable, accurate, and robust source of token price information.

This insight been formalized into the Price Oracle mechanism in Uniswap V2.
