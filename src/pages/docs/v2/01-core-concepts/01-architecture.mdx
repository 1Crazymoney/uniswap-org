## Uniswap at a glance

Uniswap is an on-chain system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, implementing an automated liquidity protocol based on a <Link to="/docs/v2/core-concepts/math"> “constant product formula” </Link>. Each Uniswap pair stores pooled reserves of two ERC20 Tokens, and provides liquidity for those two assets, maintaining the invariant that the product of the reserves cannot decrease. Traders pay a <Link to="/docs/v2/core-concepts/fees"> 30-basis-point fee </Link> on trades, which goes to liquidity providers. The contracts are non-upgradeable.

## Sustainable Ecosystem

Uniswap has three major users that keep the ecosystem healthy. Traders, Liquidity providers and Developers. Traders swap tokens with a fixed <Link to="/docs/v2/core-concepts/fees"> low fee </Link> bringing volume to the protocol. Liquidity providers are incentivized to pool tokens to capture a portion of those fees leading to better prices and lower slippage for traders. Developers can integrate with the Uniswap protocol by implementing functionality within the smart contracts leading to new interfaces, integrations and experiences increasing the potential traders and LPs in the system.

These interactions drive a positive feedback loop and increase the ability for the token economy to thrive by defining a common language by which to pool, trade and develop on top of liquidity.
