## Uniswap at a glance

Uniswap is an on-chain system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, implementing an automated liquidity protocol based on a <Link to="/docs/v2/core-concepts/math"> “constant product formula” </Link>. Each Uniswap pair stores pooled reserves of two ERC20 Tokens, and provides liquidity for those two assets, maintaining the invariant that the product of the reserves cannot decrease. Traders pay a <Link to="/docs/v2/core-concepts/fees"> 30-basis-point fee </Link> on trades, which goes to liquidity providers. The contracts are non-upgradeable.

## Sustainable Ecosystem

Uniswap has three major users that keep the ecosystem healthy. Traders, Liquidity providers and Developers. Traders swap tokens with a fixed <Link to="/docs/v2/core-concepts/fees"> low fee </Link> bringing volume to the protocol. Liquidity providers are incentivized to pool tokens to capture a portion of those fees leading to better prices and lower slippage for traders. Developers can integrate with the Uniswap protocol by implementing functionality within the smart contracts leading to new interfaces, integrations and experiences increasing the potential traders and LPs in the system.

These interactions drive a positive feedback loop and increase the ability for the token economy to thrive by defining a common language by which to pool, trade and develop on top of liquidity.

## Core/Helper Architecture Overview

[Uniswap V2 Core](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core) are the essential Uniswap V2 smart contracts, consisting of:

- [UniswapV2Pair.sol](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol), which implements core swapping and liquidity provision functionality
- [UniswapV2Factory.sol](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Factory.sol), which deploys [UniswapV2Pair.sol](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol) contracts for any ERC20 token/ERC20 token pair

**Core is minimalist in design, removing all logic that is not strictly necessary to secure liquidity stored in its pools.** Logic related to trader security or ease-of-use must be implemented in external helper contracts. Since external helpers can be improved and replaced without needing to migrate liquidity, **this improves on the flexibility and modularity of Uniswap.**

[Uniswap V2 Periphery](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery) (periphery) is an initial set of helpers, including:

- [A router contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Router01.sol) that performs the safety checks needed for safely swapping, adding, and removing liquidity.
- [A migrator contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Migrator.sol) that can remove liquidity from Uniswap V1 and deposit it into Uniswap V2 in a single transaction.
- [A library contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/libraries/UniswapV2Library.sol) that can be used in the creation of other helper contracts.
- [An example oracle contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/examples/ExampleOracleSimple.sol) that creates a simple TWAP from Uniswap V2 cumulative prices.
- [An example flash swap contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/examples/ExampleFlashSwap.sol) that withdraws ERC20 tokens, executes arbitrary code, and then pays for them.

_Periphery contracts described as "Example" are for illustrative purposes only and should not be used in actual transactions._

## Notes

- Core uses WETH instead of ETH. Routers can convert between ETH and WETH allowing users to use ETH directly
- Core stores ERC20 token balances internally instead of relying on the balances stored in the ERC20 token contract
- Core no longer calls **transferFrom** on **msg.sender**. Instead ERC20 tokens should be sent to core directly by a router before calling the **swap** , **mint** or **burn** functions.
- Core will determine the number of ERC20 tokens sent to it based on the difference between its current and stored balances.
- Core no longer returns the maximum number of ERC20 tokens for a given input amount. Instead, a router must specify the number of ERC20 tokens it wants. Core will send this number as long as the invariant is preserved after taking 0.3% off any input amount.
- Routers should handle logic around slippage safety checks and multihop trades.
