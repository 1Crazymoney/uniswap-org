# Sending Tokens

Typically, smart contracts which need tokens to perform some functionality require would-be interactors to first make an approval on the token contract, then call a function that in turn calls transferFrom on the token contract. This is _not_ how V2 pairs accept tokens. Instead, pairs check their token balances at the _end_ of every interaction. Then, at the beginning of the _next_ interaction, current balances are differenced against the stored values to determine the amount of tokens that were sent by the current interactor. See the <a href='/whitepaper.pdf' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>whitepaper</a> for a justification of why this is the case, but the takeaway is that **tokens must be transferred to the pair before calling any token-requiring method** (the one exception to this rule is <Link to='/docs/v2/flash-swaps'>Flash Swaps</Link>).
