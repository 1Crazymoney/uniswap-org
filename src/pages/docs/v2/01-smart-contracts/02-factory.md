# Code

[`UniswapV2Factory.sol`](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Factory.sol)

# Address

The `UniswapV2Factory` contract is deployed at `...` on the Ethereum mainnet, and the Ropsten, Rinkeby, GÃ¶rli, and Kovan testnets.

# Read-Only Functions

## getExchange

```solidity
function getExchange(address tokenA, address tokenB) external view returns (address exchange);
```

Returns the address of the exchange for `tokenA` and `tokenB`, if it has been created, else `address(0)` (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`).

- `tokenA` and `tokenB` are interchangeable.
- Exchange addresses can also be calculated deterministically, see <Link to='/docs/v2/technical-considerations/exchange-addresses'>Exchange Addresses</Link>.

## allExchanges

```solidity
function allExchanges(uint) external view returns (address exchange);
```

Returns the address of the `n`th exchange (`0`-indexed) created through the factory, or `address(0)` (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) if not enough exchanges have been created yet.

- Pass `0` for the address of the first exchange created, `1` for the second, etc.

## allExchangesLength

```solidity
function allExchangesLength() external view returns (uint);
```

Returns the total number of exchanges created through the factory so far.

# State-Changing Functions

## createExchange

```solidity
function createExchange(address tokenA, address tokenB) external returns (address exchange);
```

Creates an exchange for `tokenA` and `tokenB` if one doesn't exist already.

- `tokenA` and `tokenB` are interchangeable.
- Emits [ExchangeCreated](#exchangecreated).

# Events

## ExchangeCreated

```solidity
event ExchangeCreated(address indexed token0, address indexed token1, address exchange, uint);
```

Emitted each time an exchange is created via [createExchange](#createexchange).

- `token0` is guaranteed to be strictly less than `token1` by sort order.
- The final `uint` log value will be `1` for the first exchange created, `2` for the second, etc. (see [allExchanges](#allexchanges)/[getExchange](#getexchange)).
