## Creating a New Pool

Users can also use the interface to create new pools. To do this they can click the 'create pool' button on the bottom of the 'Pool' page.

#### Selecting Tokens

On this page users must select the two tokens that will make up the pair. If the two selected tokens already exist as a pool a link will appear to that existing pool.

ETH is selected by default as one of the tokens, but users have the option to select any two tokens they want. Common bases will be shown in the token modal. These tokens are most commonly used but again, not required. The order of the tokens does not matter, and after both have been selected a user can continue to set initial rates for the new pool.

#### Setting initial rates

As the first liquidity provider a user is responsible for setting the initial rate for the pool. To set the rate the user can set the desired amount to provide for each token in the pair respectively. This ratio will be displayed in the details section of the page, and will be used as the initial rate within the pool. To learn more about pools and why this initial rate is important to set correctly see [here](/docs/v2/liquidity-pools/anatomy-of-a-liquidity-pool/).

#### Creating the Pool

Once the user is happy with the initial rates they may need to approve the tokens being supplied (described above under approvals). After both tokens have been approved the user can click confirm, review information about the transaction, and submit to their connected wallet for final approval.
