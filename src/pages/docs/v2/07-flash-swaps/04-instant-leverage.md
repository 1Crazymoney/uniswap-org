Flash swaps can be used to improve the efficiency of levering up using lending protocols and Uniswap.

Consider Maker in its simplest form: a system which accepts ETH as collateral and allows DAI to be minted against it while ensuring that the value of the ETH never drops below 150% of the value of the DAI.

Say we use this system to deposit a principal amount of 3 ETH, and mint the maximum amount of DAI. At a price of 1 ETH / 200 DAI, we receive 400 DAI. In theory, we could lever this position up by selling the DAI for more ETH, depositing this ETH, minting the maximum amount of DAI (which would be less this time), and repeating until we've reached our desired leverage level.

It's quite simple to use Uniswap as a liquidity source for the DAI-to-ETH component of this process. However, looping through protocols in this way isn't particularly elegant, and can be gas-intensive.

Luckily, flash swaps enable us to withdraw the _full_ ETH amount upfront. If we wanted 2x leverage against our 3 ETH principal, we could simply request 3 ETH in a flash swap and deposit 6 ETH into Maker. This gives us the ability to mint 800 DAI. If we mint as much as we need to cover our flash swap (say 605), the remainder serves as a safety margin against price movements.
