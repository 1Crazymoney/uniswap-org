The pages that follow contain comprehensive documentation of the Uniswap V2 ecosystem. Briefly, Uniswap is a protocol for exchanging ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. It eliminates trusted intermediaries and unnecessary forms of rent extraction, allowing for fast, efficient trading. Where it makes tradeoffs decentralization, censorship resistance, and security are prioritized. Uniswap is open-source software licensed under GPL.

## How Uniswap works

Understand the design decisions behind Uniswap in the <Link to="/docs/v2/protocol-overview/architecture/">protocol architecture</Link> overview.

The two main concepts that underpin Uniswap are <Link to="/docs/v2/swaps/overview">Swaps</Link> and <Link to="/docs/v2/pools/overview">Pools</Link>.

Learn how they work in practice in <Link to="/docs/v2/swaps/anatomy-of-a-swap">Anatomy of a Swap</Link> and <Link to="/docs/v2/pools/anatomy-of-a-pool">Anatomy of a Pool</Link>.

Explore the sidebar to find more specific documentation covering other aspects of the protocol.
