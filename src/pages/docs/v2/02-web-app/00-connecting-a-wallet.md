#### Connecting a Wallet

Users must connect with a supported wallet before making transactions. To connect a wallet, a user should click one of the "connect" buttons in the top corner or the main section of the interface. Next, they can select one of the supported wallet options from the list (different on mobile vs desktop). This will establish a web3 connection in the browser allowing the user to structure and approve transactions. To learn more about wallets [see here](https://ethereum.org/wallets/).
