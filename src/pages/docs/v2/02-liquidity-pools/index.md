Uniswap is unique in that it doesn’t use an order book to match buyers and sellers of tokens or to derive the price of an asset.

Instead, Uniswap uses liquidity pools between tokens. When trading ETH for a token, ETH is sent to the contract’s pool and the token is given back to the user. As a result, the user doesn’t need to wait for a counter-party in order to exchange or worry about specifying a price.

Contrary to a conventional exchange, trading fees are not going to the exchange itself or to the Uniswap team but instead rewarded to users who provide liquidity in the marketplace.

In Uniswap, anyone can deposit their tokens in order to provide liquidity.

Because Uniswap is built using smart contracts that run autonomously on Ethereum, there is no central gatekeeper or operator of the protocol. This means that anyone can add a token to the marketplace by creating a new liquidity pool through the Uniswap factory contract.
