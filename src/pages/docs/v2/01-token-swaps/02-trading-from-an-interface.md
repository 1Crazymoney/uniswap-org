To make a swap, you will need a web3 enabled browser. For your desktop, you can either use the MetaMask extension either in Chrome, Firefox or Opera, or you can use the Brave Browser. Mobile browsers compatible to Web3 are Trust Wallet and Coinbase Wallet. To find other compatible browsers read the web3 docs.

In the examples below, I used MetaMask. In the first image, you will see a small amount of ETH, and I chose to swap this to GRID. It is pretty straightforward, you fill in the amount of ETH you want to use and click on one of the tokens from the list. Then click the 'Swap' button.

MetaMask will now open up and ask to either confirm or reject the transaction as shown below.

And within a short time, in my case this was a few seconds, you will have swapped ETH or any ERC20 token for another.

As with any new exchange, it is wise to first try to swap a small amount before trading larger volumes.
