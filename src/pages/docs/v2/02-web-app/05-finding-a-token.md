title: 'Finding a token'
---

Uniswap is permissionless protocol. Many pools can be created that may not appear by default on the frontend. To find a token to swap you'll need to find the address of the token either via the token's community or through [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/).

A token address looks like `0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f` (this is the address for DAI). Once you find the token you're looking for on etherscan, you can copy the address by finding the `Contract` section on the token information page.

By searching on the interface with the token address the token will be added to to your list and stored in localstorage in your browser. After completing this step, the token will become searchable by its ticker or token name.

You can always remove a token by finding it in the list and clicking remove.
